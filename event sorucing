Event Sourcing system: 1. Events, 2. Calculators, 3. Aggregates and 4. Reactors.

1. Events 
2. Aggregates represent the current state of the application.
3. Calculators read events and update aggregates accordingly.
4. Reactors “react” to events as they are created. 

In other words,

1. Events to provide a history
2. Aggregates to represent the current state of the application
3. Calculator to update the state of the application
4. Reactors to trigger side effects as events happen

All changes to an application state are stored as a sequence of events.
